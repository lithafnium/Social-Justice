# Social-Justice

Built for the MIT Blueprint 2019 Hackathon with Hugo Zhang. 

Our vision was to create an online platform where users can introduce social justice issues within their area in order to gain support from the public. 
People can post issues they feel are important to them on our platform, and other users, if they feel that they want to add their support, can add their voice to the problem. 
Once the poster feels they have enough supporters, they have the option to contact their local representatives.
